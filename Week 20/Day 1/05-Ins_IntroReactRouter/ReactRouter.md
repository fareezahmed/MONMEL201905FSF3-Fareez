# React Router overview:

- ## React Router is a library made up of special components for conditionally rendering other components based on the current URL path.

- ## How React Router works under the hood isn't fundamentally different from the previous example we coded out where we conditionally rendered certain components based on our component state using if/else statements.

- ## React Router has modules for routing React applications on the web, in native applications, and on the server. In our case, we're going to be working with React Router on the web.

- ## While a little intimidating at first, the React Router Documentation is some of the best for any library we've covered so far, full of concise and helpful examples.

- ## We won't have enough time to teach all of React Router, nor will students need to know all of the library. Instead we'll be going over the fundamental ~20% of syntax that they're likely going to be using 80% of the time. After that, students should feel more comfortable going through the official documentation for answers.
